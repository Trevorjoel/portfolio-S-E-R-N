# cra-express-mysql

This project is another stack experimentation for my new portfolio. It has been made from the boilerplate code at: https://github.com/Trevorjoel/cra-express-mysql
Here I am adding the front end framework foundation to see how it ties in with React components.
NODE, EXPRESS, MYSQL, CREATE REACT APP & Foundation.


# Project was an experimentation in front end build tools.
## Findings:


Foundation-sites is cool but it's not well supported with React. 


Bootstrap + React or 'react-strap' provides far better community and documentation support.

Initially I didn't want to use bootstrap because sometimes the front end of bootstrap sites have a 'signature' style that I wanted to avoid. 

I learnt that with scss files it's easy to customise styles so I should end up with the style of portfolio I have designed.

The next step of my portfolio journey is putting all of the pieces together.


I've settled on the design, tools and architecture. 

Now I need to really get to know these tools.

I might have to do some tutorials on implementation of solutions but i'm on my way.

The next step can be seen here.
